## 0.2.0
- Reorganize internals under engine/ while preserving public API
- Reducer init is now async fn init(&mut self, ctx: InitContext<SideEffect>)
- Engines must be created after oxide_core::runtime::init(...) (exposed via app-level initOxide() FRB API)
- Unified FRB-based runtime for store task spawning (native/web/WASI aware)
- Build for wasm32-unknown-unknown and wasm32-wasip1 with all features
- Add web persistence backend (localStorage + base64) for state persistence
- Replace persistence OS thread with a debounced async worker
- WASM-safe background spawning (web uses spawn_local; WASI uses a runtime handle)
- Add StateChange::Infer and StateChange::Slices variants for partial updates
- Extend StateSnapshot with slices field to carry slice metadata
